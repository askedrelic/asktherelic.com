    <p>Tinkering with my configuration and dotfiles is a never ending hobby. After
finding Github&rsquo;s guide to <a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">dotfile configurations</a>, I evaluated several of
the repos and decided to upgrade <a href="https://github.com/askedrelic/dotfiles/">my own dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p>For the longest time, my home directory (<code class="prettyprint">/home/askedrelic</code> on most systems) has
been a git repo. This has mostly worked but has several problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>everything writes to your home directory; you wind up with many of untracked
files, unless you ignore them, which is then a pain to keep updating your
<code class="prettyprint">.gitignore</code></li>
<li>easy to add files; mistype a filename or tab-complete and your whole <code class="prettyprint">.ssh</code>
folder could get added with your private keys</li>
<li>impossible to keep any sensitive files (atlhough this is mostly a side effect
of keeping my dotfiles public on Github)</li>
<li>hard to initialize on new machines; git likes to clone to an empty directory
and your home directory is never empty, even on new machines</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these complaints, this method has worked out me for several years. It
has allowed me to use default git functionality (git-submodules) for my vim
plugins and easily keep them up to date. I can git-pull and have the latest
configurations by re-opening my shell.</p>

<p>I wanted a way to upgrade my existing repo with minimal changes and keep my
git-submodules. Several of the Github recommended dotfile repos were not
interesting to me for their forced use of ZSH or complex Ruby/Rake scripts to
handle updating. I have a bit of sunk cost with Bash and wanted the option to
gradually upgrade to ZSH.</p>

<p>Therefore <a href="https://github.com/holman/dotfiles">Zach Holman&rsquo;s dotfiles</a> looked best to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>easy upgrade/install using a Bash bootstrap script with no magic</li>
<li>support for symlinked files or directories to allow my git-submodule use to
continue</li>
<li>no forced ZSH configuration</li>
<li>great topic based organization of files</li>
</ul>

<p>It took a few tries to figure out copying his <code class="prettyprint">script/bootstrap</code> was mainly what
I wanted. Moving my existing git-submodules to a new location was obtusely hard,
until I found a script to handle it:
<a href="https://github.com/iam-TJ/git-submodule-move">https://github.com/iam-TJ/git-submodule-move</a>.</p>

<p>The upgrade was basically:</p>

<ol>
<li><code class="prettyprint">git clone https://github.com/askedrelic/dotfiles/ .dotfiles</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">cd .dotfiles &amp;&amp; script/bootstrap</code></li>
<li>Follow the prompts and overwrite or backup any files I am trying to symlink</li>
</ol>

<p>This new layout allows for much better organization going forward. Check it out
here and see your dotfiles could use an upgrade:

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
    <p>You might not be able to call it a New Years Resolution anyone, but it&rsquo;s not too
late to backup everything you did online last year. I usually get around <a href="/2012/01/02/backup-everything-you-did-last-year/">to
doing this in December/January</a> over Christmas holiday, but this year I have
been slacking. Maybe you have too. It&rsquo;s not too late, make a backup!</p>

<h3>Files</h3>

<p>I have a couple services that I use for my documents, my writing, my photos, and
everything else that is a file. Files are easiest to deal with, as long you have
them organized easily. You always want your files in two places (your current
computer and online), since you will drop your laptop and your current HDD will
fail randomly. You want your files in a simple file format that doesn&rsquo;t depend
on a specific application: usually text, lossless image (PNG), or PDF. PDF might
be a terrible format for technical reasons, but it&rsquo;s a great way to preserve
websites or Word documents exactly how they currently are. Every application has
&ldquo;Print as PDF&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="https://db.tt/xduLbMk">Dropbox</a> is the natural choice for most temporary files. You can get 2GB to 5GB
free starting out, it is constantly backed up when you are connected to the
internet, and instantly available across all your devices. I keep most temporary
files in my Dropbox folder, until I can organize them by date and archive them
in a more permanent way.</p>

<p>A more permanent home solution for large file backup is an external HDD or NAS.
I finally invested in a consumer NAS last year, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008U68UHG?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=as2">Synology Diskstation
DS213</a> for about $200. Drobo is a another well known consumer NAS, but way
too expensive in my opinion, especially considering how cheap hardware has
become. The Synology has really impressed me in ease of use, software quality,
and overall value. Dual disk RAID support, gigabit ethernet, and &ldquo;app&rdquo; support
with automatic AWS Glacier backup are some of the more technical features that
really make it impressive. <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/synology-diskstation-ds21/">Here is another good review</a>, from the
Wirecutter.</p>

<p>To balance everything out, you want permanent offsite backups: <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a> or
<a href="https://www.code42.com/crashplan/">Crashplan</a> are both good. I&rsquo;ve used Backblaze for years at work, but am
considering Crashplan personally, since <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/edrive.html">Backblaze does not support backing up
NAS</a>. These programs are similar to Dropbox, but offer a longterm backup for
around $50/year, which is a great price for safety and value of an offsite
backup.</p>

<h3>Important Online Services</h3>

<p>Now that you have someplace to backup files, backup every important online
service you used last year into a simple file format.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: most online email providers are now offering simple backup
solutions, <a href="https://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/download-copy-of-your-gmail-and-google.html">even Gmail</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Passwords</strong>: I also switched this year to religiously using <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>,
an application that stores all of your passwords and automatically fills them
in, like when you need to access your bank account website. This has not only
made my life easier, but improved the overall security of my passwords, since
1Password can generate a unique password for each website you use. I can write
volumes about this topic, but for now, get some application that stores your
passwords for you.</li>
<li><strong>Bank account and credit card statements</strong>: all my banking is done online
with e-paper statements. It saves time and paper. At the end of the year, most
banks offer a Year End Summary, which you should download and store as a PDF.
Most banks store these statements for up to seven years, but why not keep the
copy locally? It makes keeping financial records much easier.</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarks</strong>: Pinboard is an online bookmark service I use, which <a href="https://pinboard.in/export/">offers an
export here</a>. If you just use Firefox or Chrome bookmarks and have
hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, back them up!</li>
<li><strong>Social media services</strong>: I used to find value in Twitter, Facebook,
LinkedIn, but lately, I don&rsquo;t think the value is worth longterm backing up.
JWZ argues for backing these services up and <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/01/psa-back-up-your-shit/">offers some helpful
exporters</a>. Facebook offers an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings">export under Settings</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account">Twitter
does also</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physical Things</h3>

<p>Another project I started last year was backing up my childhood photo albums and
VHS tapes! Well, I called my mom and asked her to mail them to me, but it&rsquo;s
a first step. How many boxes of tapes or old photographs do you have at your
parent&rsquo;s house? Convert them to a digital format today, before they fall apart.</p>

<p><span class="aligncenter">
<img alt="Legoland 1994" src="/pic/legoland94.jpg" />
</span></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at local video conversion places and have been quoted $25/tape for
VHS to digital conversions, which seems pricey. I think I will wait to find
a VCR and manually convert the videos myself with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029U2YSA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0029U2YSA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=asktherelic-20">Elgato USB recorder</a>,
which seems to offer a good value/quality trade off.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my recommendation for the year. Everything that is physical fades
eventually and everything that is digital can instantly disappear if you aren&rsquo;t
careful. Understand the digital world and do what is necessary to preserve your
important memories and documents!</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
    <p>After recently <a href="/2013/08/22/the-birthday-surprise/">joining a much larger company</a> and taking a look at my team&rsquo;s
product from different perspectives, I&rsquo;ve found new value from testing. While
running a small startup exploring a business market, trying new features was
a daily or weekly affair; you have to make tradeoffs with code quality, feature
set, or speed of delivery. Code testing, especially in quantity of unit tests,
had been something I usually traded for speed of delivery. If I can deliver
a feature that looks correct from a high-level business perspective, then the
code is probably correct based upon my experience with the programming language.
However, no programmer is perfect and preparing for failure is a good idea.</p>

<h3>Basic Testing</h3>

<p>Testing can be approached from many different ways, with different goals. At the
unit test level, you are essentially testing your API:</p>

<ul>
<li>is the API easy to use; how hard is the code to test (a great smell for bad
code)</li>
<li>did I really build what I wanted to build</li>
<li>is it extensible; how many dependencies does the code have</li>
</ul>

<p>This what many developers think tests are. I have always felt these were
important from an academic standpoint, but definitely never gave them their due
respect. Unit tests are a great way to explore your code and reflect whether it
still makes sense on a second glance. No matter how trivial or simple the code
may be, having the ability to change your mind repeatably, with verified
results, is useful.</p>

<p>Moving to a higher level, functional or system tests are good to determine if
3rd-party libraries and your application as a whole is working correctly, and
usually where I have spent much of my time from a return on time investment.
Either the system works or it doesn&rsquo;t and this can be traced down quickly. This
is something I have begun to focus less on, due to getting better gains from
improved unit testing. This is basically the debate over <a href="http://superprofundo.com/2010/12/13/top-down-and-bottom-up-pros-and-cons/">top-down versus
bottom-up</a> design and I think testing at both ends of the spectrum is
important.</p>

<h3>Communicating The Code</h3>

<p>This point has been one of the bigger breakthroughs I&rsquo;ve made: tests communicate
the spec. When I&rsquo;m building a feature, I usually iteratively write code until
I say it works. I&rsquo;m continually running the code and I am doing the evaluating
of the output to determine that the computer is generating correct output. But
moving that evaluation step into into code and automating is a big, very useful,
step. This is essentially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-driven_development">BDD</a>; letting business people write a code spec
and having to match that spec.</p>

<p>Once a feature has been communicated into a code spec, changing that feature
later becomes a migration; not having to start from scratch to ensure all my
assumptions still work with subtle changes.</p>

<p>As my team has gotten larger, being able to say my code does something and then
have a test to prove it helps with async communication and increases the speed
of integration. Having a second source of code truth keeps everyone on the same
page about what the code is doing and helps smooth the merge process.</p>

<p>For an open source project, having public tests helps show your concern for code
quality and is an easy way for knowledgeable developers to jump into your code:
how do I use your code? Well, I can always check out the tests because they
better work. Across many projects, documentation is pretty rare or of poor
quality. Both tests and documentation are important for your project, but while
documentation fades with time, test code has a very binary usefulness.</p>

<h3>Check Yo Self Before You Wreck Yo Self</h3>

<p>Coming from doing most of my coding in Python and dynamic languages, this
concern may not be as important in static languages like C#/Java, but I think it
is still important.</p>

<p>Tests help verify your assumptions. Returning to my original point, failure will
happen and trying to plan for is a much better solution than waiting until it
happens. Dynamic typing makes it faster to write code and but pushes many errors
to become runtime errors. The number of times I&rsquo;ve run into date/time/datetime
conversion errors in Python has definitely pushed me to test more. I can assume
what code is doing all day long, until I actually test it and find that one
instance when the API does something you weren&rsquo;t expecting. Even assuming that
you really understand dates or <a title="Seriously, what the hell" href="http://blog.counsyl.com/2013/09/27/true-facts-about-time-zones/">timezones</a> is often incorrect.</p>

<p>When you run into a new problem, having a test environment setup that you can
easily jump into will save time and get you fixing things quicker. The more you
invest in the test environment, the easier it is to solve new types of problems
and quickly diagnose problems when they arise.</p>

<h3>In Closing</h3>

<p>How much to test, what areas to test, what type of testing to use: these
questions are always up for debate. Any level of testing is good and you can
probably improve. In the world of <a href="http://github.com/askedrelic/">GitHub</a>, you rarely code &ldquo;alone&rdquo;; someone will
always read your code and making it easier for them to read and analyze is
a good thing. Finally, double checking yourself is a good thing. Testing is an
investment, sometimes the return may take awhile to surface, but improving your
testing ability is one step to becoming a better programmer.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
    <p>For a recent hackathon project, I wanted to setup a client/server
configuration, all in Python, so that the server could run shell commands and
stream the output back to the client. The client was a Raspberry Pi and the
server was my laptop, which already had my real project setup.</p>

<p>My first thought was to do this over HTTP, with <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html">Requests</a> for the client
and <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Bottle</a> for the server. I started writing some code, checked the Bottle
docs for <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#generating-content">sending a streaming response</a>, and was running with a few lines.</p>
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">bottle</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">subprocess</span>

<span class="nd">@bottle.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'/stream'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">stream</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">proc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="s">'echo 1 &amp;&amp; sleep 3 &amp;&amp; echo 2 &amp;&amp; sleep 3 &amp;&amp; echo 3'</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">shell</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">stdout</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PIPE</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">poll</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stdout</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\r\n</span><span class="s">"</span>

<span class="n">bottle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">debug</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">bottle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">host</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'0.0.0.0'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">8000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">reloader</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This code worked great in Chrome; console output was streamed with pauses and
the connection was not dropped.</p>

<p>Then I started on a client in Python. Requests also <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#streaming-requests">supports streaming
responses</a>, just a parameter to the standard <code class="prettyprint">requests.get()</code>, nothing too
major.</p>
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>

<span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'http://0.0.0.0:8000'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stream</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">iter_lines</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">line</span>
</code></pre>

<h3>The First Mistake</h3>

<p>After running the client a few times, the output wasn&rsquo;t getting streamed.
Output would pop in, as if the response was fully downloading before printing.
I tried increasing the sleep amount, to see if the response was too short and
tweaking the python handling of output, trying to find some sort of implicit
stdout buffering with <code class="prettyprint">export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=True</code>. I rewrote the server in
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/">Flask</a>, which offers the same streaming capabilities as Bottle, but
encountered the same situation with the client not streaming the response.
After consulting with teammates, we couldn&rsquo;t see the problem and moved on to
trying to stream a local SSH connection instead, which had its own host of
environment problems.</p>

<p>The one variable I didn&rsquo;t tweak in these examples was the response size, which
seems obviously when looking back now. My first mistake was not testing
boundary cases: all the minimum viable tests were extremely small and not
extremely different. I moved on too quickly without diving deep enough into the
problem: the docs and samples were all so simple, so I assumed nothing could be
wrong with the libraries I&rsquo;m using.</p>

<h3>The Second Mistake</h3>

<p>This hackathon was all for fun, so I gave up and moved onto the next problem,
but I returned the next day and dived deeper. My second mistake was trusting
the docs: documentation is a great resource, but code never lies.</p>

<p>After looking at the function declaration for the <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/v2.0.0/requests/models.py#L593"><code class="prettyprint">response.iter_lines()</code></a>,
it quickly made sense: the default chunk size for the lines in the response was
512 bytes, which <code class="prettyprint">1 2 3</code> would never get chunked into multiple pieces. I was
also not sending <code class="prettyprint">\r\n</code>, the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding">HTTP chunked terminator</a>.</p>
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="n">ITER_CHUNK_SIZE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">512</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">iter_lines</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">chunk_size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">ITER_CHUNK_SIZE</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">decode_unicode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Setting <code class="prettyprint">chunk_size=1</code> made my client immediately print output, solving all my
problems.</p>

<h3>For Next Time</h3>

<p>To make testing easier, I&rsquo;ve created a Github repo to demo all this code:
<a href="https://github.com/askedrelic/streaming-demo">https://github.com/askedrelic/streaming-demo</a>.</p>

<p>While debugging this situation, I remembered to try HTTPie, <a href="https://github.com/jkbr/httpie">a cURL replacement
written in Python using Requests</a>, which handled the streaming response
correctly. Looking at HTTPie&rsquo;s code for consuming responses, led to me look at
Request&rsquo;s code and figure everything out. Definitely recommend this tool!</p>

<p>Lastly, always check the code and don&rsquo;t be afraid to dive deep.</p>

<p>This method for selecting an input stood out to me for being so simple: just
a numbered list. Many command line applications make input too complex, making
the user think about <em>what</em> they want to select, making them type it in
again, while many don&rsquo;t even support tab complete.</p>

<p>Several months ago, I was on an airplane with no internet and decided to
challenge myself to implement that select interface in Python. When looking at
the code again, I found it was just a Bash builtin function:</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="k">select </span>name <span class="o">[</span> <span class="k">in </span>word <span class="o">]</span> ; <span class="k">do </span>list ; <span class="k">done
    </span>The list of words following <span class="k">in </span>is expanded, generating a list of items. The
    <span class="nb">set </span>of expanded words is printed on the standard error, each preceded by
    a number. If the <span class="k">in </span>word is omitted, the positional parameters are printed
    <span class="o">(</span>see PARAMETERS below<span class="o">)</span>. The PS3 prompt is <span class="k">then </span>displayed and a line <span class="nb">read
    </span>from the standard input. If the line consists of a number corresponding to
    one of the displayed words, <span class="k">then </span>the value of name is <span class="nb">set </span>to that word. If
    the line is empty, the words and prompt are displayed again. If EOF is <span class="nb">read</span>,
    the <span class="nb">command </span>completes. Any other value <span class="nb">read </span>causes name to be <span class="nb">set </span>to null.
    The line <span class="nb">read </span>is saved <span class="k">in </span>the variable REPLY. The list is executed after
    each selection <span class="k">until </span>a <span class="nb">break command </span>is executed. The <span class="nb">exit </span>status of <span class="k">select
    </span>is the <span class="nb">exit </span>status of the last <span class="nb">command </span>executed <span class="k">in </span>list, or zero <span class="k">if </span>no
    commands were executed.
</code></pre>

<p>I started hacking, got it working, then forgot it about. Now coming back to the
code with an internet connection, I&rsquo;ve released it on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyselect">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/askedrelic/pyselect">Github</a>.</p>

<h3>Pyselect</h3>

<p>Pyselect wraps <code class="prettyprint">raw_input()</code>, more or less:</p>
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pyselect</span>
<span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">pyselect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">'apples'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'oranges'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'bananas'</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">apples</span>
<span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">oranges</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">bananas</span>
<span class="c">#? 2</span>
<span class="n">Out</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="s">'oranges'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>But can also be used as a Python module, when scripting:</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>python -m pyselect <span class="k">$(</span>ls<span class="k">)</span>
1<span class="o">)</span> LICENSE.txt
2<span class="o">)</span> build/
3<span class="o">)</span> dist/
4<span class="o">)</span> pyselect.egg-info/
5<span class="o">)</span> pyselect.py
6<span class="o">)</span> pyselect.pyc
7<span class="o">)</span> setup.py
8<span class="o">)</span> test.py
<span class="c">#? 4</span>
pyselect.egg-info/
</code></pre>

<p>Or in a Bash pipe:</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>ls | xargs python -m pyselect
1<span class="o">)</span> LICENSE.txt
2<span class="o">)</span> build/
3<span class="o">)</span> dist/
4<span class="o">)</span> pyselect.egg-info/
5<span class="o">)</span> pyselect.py
6<span class="o">)</span> pyselect.pyc
7<span class="o">)</span> setup.py
8<span class="o">)</span> test.py
<span class="c">#? 5</span>
pyselect.py
</code></pre>

<p>But that&rsquo;s where things kind of fall apart. Within a standard interactive Python
application, stdin and stdout are simple and pyselect just works. Getting the
pipe-in to work required a bit more work, hooking in/out up the user&rsquo;s tty,
which the pipe drops. My holy grail would be a pipe-in and pipe-out to make
selecting anything much easier:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ ls | xargs python -m pyselect | cp $0 test.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Or display all your git branches and jump to one. Or virtualenvs. Or
directories. Double pipe redirects the pyselect output/input and doesn&rsquo;t work.
I&rsquo;ve read up on named pipes that might be able to solve this, but I haven&rsquo;t
found a Python solution yet.</p>

<p>To jump between git branches with bash select, I used this:</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="k">function </span>gobranch<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">select </span>branch <span class="k">in</span> <span class="k">$(</span>git <span class="k">for</span>-each-ref --sort<span class="o">=</span>-committerdate refs/heads/ --format<span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'%(refname)'</span> | sed <span class="s1">'s/refs\/heads\///g'</span><span class="k">)</span>; <span class="k">do
        </span>git checkout <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$branch</span><span class="s2">"</span>
        <span class="nb">break</span>;
    <span class="k">done</span>;
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>

<p>For now, I have some other ideas to try with selecting things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto-select an option when you have less than 9 options and enter 1-9, no need
to hit the enter key</li>
<li>A-Z input, maybe default to home row, ala <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion">vim-easymotion</a></li>
<li>Multi-option select, 1-4 ala <code class="prettyprint">git add --interactive</code> mode</li>
<li>Integration with Fabric perhaps, which has <a href="http://fabric.readthedocs.org/en/1.8/api/contrib/console.html">some simple input functions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, pyselect could become &ldquo;input for humans&rdquo;, ala <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a>, because
<code class="prettyprint">raw_input()</code> could always use a more friendly API.</p>

    <p>It has now been several weeks since my twenty-seventh birthday. A birthday is
generally always a reason to celebrate, but this birthday, my <a href="http://officialblog.yelp.com/2013/07/welcoming-seatme-to-yelp.html">startup was
acquired by Yelp</a> several days beforehand, which makes this birthday extra
special!</p>

<p>Startups are hard work. Finding a market, building a product, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">growing that
product</a>, figuring out which corners to cut, or not cut; it&rsquo;s all hard work,
even though some may make it look easy. I was lucky to be one of the early
engineers at SeatMe and am proud of the team and product we helped build, while
learning some new things along the way. Yelp is a great company with a great
culture and I&rsquo;m looking forward now to continuing to grow the product. </p>

<p>While it was a busy week with that announcement, there was still time to reflect
and evaluate the last year. I think it&rsquo;s good to have milestones and evaluate
your progress along the way. I don&rsquo;t mean that life is a race, but I do find
value in judging where I am in life. <a href="http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/george-saunderss-advice-to-graduates/">Am I a better person than last year?</a>
Have I learned new skills? What skills do I want to learn? <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178211966454607.html">How have I helped
others?</a> These may seem like platitudes, but I genuinely hope to improve
myself year over year.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to a good next year.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
    <p>This blog is now being built using <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>, a well documented and quite
flexible Ruby static site generator. I had a pretty good run with
<a href="http://blogofile.com/">Blogofile</a>, the previous engine used to build this blog: <a href="/2010/02/25/a-new-branch/">over three
years</a>. I&rsquo;m well aware I spend too much time <a href="https://github.com/askedrelic/homedir">bike-shedding</a> and
re-tooling sometimes, but the Ruby community keeps pushing things forward and
Middleman has some great features worth upgrading for.</p>

<h3>The Great Solution</h3>

<p>Middleman&rsquo;s smart idea is to break everything about a website into a mix of
files, folders, and data. Files can be any format and rendered using any of
a dozen different formats, so if you want to use Markdown or any other format
for writing blog articles, you can. But you can use do Coffeescript for JS files
or Less/SASS for CSS files; they are all just files to be rendered.</p>

<p>The blog is the nicest part: it just picks up specific files that match a date
string format (&ldquo;Year-Month-Date-Blog-Post-Title&rdquo;) and makes them available as
data to blog rendering templates. You just have BlogArticle objects in the
template and you can use them anywhere in your site. Blogofile and other static
blog rendering engines I&rsquo;ve looked at focus on the &ldquo;blog&rdquo; abstraction: the
articles and then how the blog is rendered in a specific way. The Middleman
abstraction of &ldquo;blog&rdquo; data and &ldquo;blog&rdquo; templates makes much more sense to me, but
also opens the doors to building much more powerful and different sites than
just blogs. Well, as long as they are static!</p>

<h3>Other Great Things</h3>

<p>Here is my laundry list of thoughts while exploring Middleman:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to use, flexible rendering system. Doing manual CSS was a pain, but now
I will probably switch everything to SASS. Dynamic CSS is the only way I think
about CSS anymore.</li>
<li>Live reload of pages, via Rack and websockets. Very easy to live edit: web
browser on half screen, editor on half screen.</li>
<li>Great docs explaining everything about Middleman; there aren&rsquo;t many options,
but they are explained well.</li>
<li>Self introspection to figure out problems: while developing you can goto
<code class="prettyprint">http://localhost:4567/__middleman/</code> and view your dynamic configuration or
sitemap</li>
<li>Great built in support for build time site optimizations: auto-gzip of all
files, auto CSS/HTML minification, auto image shrinking, all ensuring your
built static site is very fast.</li>
<li>Since everything is just files and folders, you can have a folder for each
blog article, to keep related, like source code or presentations mentioned in
the article. It makes it really easy to setup a &ldquo;code example&rdquo; HTML page as
a sub-directory of the blog post, which is great to keep everything on the
blog itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also disabled comments on this blog. It&rsquo;s been a few fun years with Disqus,
but it&rsquo;s easier to me if people reach out on <a href="https://github.com/askedrelic">Github</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/askedrelic/">Twitter</a>, while
I can focus on writing on the blog, which I continually hope that I find more
time for.</p>

<p>If you want to check out the source, <a href="https://github.com/askedrelic/asktherelic.com">it&rsquo;s always on Github</a>.</p>

    <p>Several months ago, I had the pleasure of completing a GoRuck Light event. It
involved a seven-ish mile hike through the Presidio area of San Francisco,
getting a little wet, and finding some new limits for what I know I can
accomplish.</p>

<p><span class="aligncenter">
<img alt="Me during the GoRuck" src="/pic/goruck1.jpg" />
</span></p>

<h3>What is GoRuck?</h3>

<p>For a little backstory, <a href="http://www.goruck.com/">GoRuck</a> is an American company founded by some
ex-special forces folks (the Cadre) that makes pretty durable backpacks and has
started doing a series of military style events that physically and mentally
challenge you, while training you to work together with a random group of
people.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Challenge&rdquo; is <a href="http://news.goruck.com/videos/goruck-light-video/">their main event</a>, which involves a six, twelve,
twenty-four, or, of course, forty-eight hour hike (or ruck) while only carrying
your backpack. Your backpack must contain four bricks if you are under 150lbs,
six bricks if you are over. During the hike, there is a series of calisthenics
and physical challenges, which usually involves carrying heavy things around.</p>

<h3>Quite A Challenge</h3>

<p>My hike started at 7AM in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Presidio%2C+San+Francisco%2C+CA&amp;data=!4m11!1m10!2i4!4m8!1m3!1d3908!2d-122.4651311!3d37.7995559!3m2!1i1680!2i952!4f13.1">Presidio field</a>. After roll call, we did
several drills in the fresh morning dew, learning to work together as a team and
getting &ldquo;warmed up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a team, we headed down to Chrissy Field, where we were dipped into the San
Francisco Bay, to &ldquo;cool down.&rdquo; The general motto of the Challenge is a smile
will help you through the toughest things and the smiles on everyone&rsquo;s faces
definitely reflected how cold it was. This was probably the first time I had
doubts about what I was doing but I refocused and kept going.</p>

<p>We found several logs and the Cadre decided to that the logs would be better
positioned several miles away under the Golden Gate Bridge. We had several false
starts trying to carry them, but eventually figuring out a reasonable efficient
way of carrying the three logs as a team, rotating out tired folks and making
good progress.</p>

<p>We dropped the logs and then went in the water to cool off again. After several
rounds of pushups in the water, we were quite cooled down. We took a short
bathroom break at the hut under the bridge, and then started hiking over to the
Baker Beach. Once there, we took one final dip in the water and by this point,
I was beginning to like it!</p>

<p>The worst was over, another hike back to the starting point was all that was
left and then it was over. I was pushed to some new mental limits by this
challenge. There were several points I felt like giving up, but I pushed through
with the help of my team. I am grateful that I am healthy and fit enough to
survive something like this.</p>

frameborder="0" class="aligncenter" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3>Looking Forward To Next Time</h3>

<p>A point repeated during the challenge is that you should be useful; you should
be prepared. My next event is in five days, a twelve hour Challenge going
overnight, starting at 9PM. In the time since my last challenge, I&rsquo;ve made
a much better packing list and more prepared this time:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have better shorts and long underwear to prevent chaffing</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m bringing multiple pairs of sock in a waterproof bag, to swap out once my
current socks get wet</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m bringing more snacks</li>
<li>I have more water, with electrolyte tablets to better prevent dehydration</li>
<li>I have a yoga block for the bottom of my backpack, to shift the weight of
bricks to the top of the backpack</li>
</ul>

<p>Much of this preparation was based on my experiences and these experiences:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://community.active.com/blogs/superfiend/2011/05/05/the-goruck-challenge">http://community.active.com/blogs/superfiend/2011/05/05/the-goruck-challenge</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to being prepared!</p>

    <p>There is definite value to moving where you work and frequently changing your
perspective on your work, when you are looking for ideas. I have gotten some of
my best ideas recently from conferences, traveling to PyCon in Santa Clara and
this past weekend, Write the Docs in Portland.</p>

<h3>The What</h3>

<p><a href="http://conf.writethedocs.org/">Write the Docs</a> is a conference organized to talk about documentation, for
those who document, organize, and share information. It originated as a crazy
idea over beers, but the founders kept investigating and figured out how they
could actually make a conference happen. I found out about it via Hacker News
and decided to sign up as a cheap and fun trip to Portland.</p>

<p>The conference was on a Monday/Tuesday. I fly up from San Francisco the Saturday
before and hung out for the weekend. On Sunday, there was a meet and greet hike,
followed by a meet and greet beer bash. I had a great time: from meeting so many
cool people, to getting exposed to many different new ideas about why or how to
write. The conference was held in a theatre with a single track of talks and it
was a great format to be able to sit back and focus on a talk, without having to
worry about missing anything.</p>

<h3>The Talks</h3>

<p>If anything, there were too many great talks to process in two short days, but
I think everyone managed. There seemed to be a good fifty/fifty mix of
programmers to technical writers. <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/talks.html#kenneth-reitz">Kenneth Reitz</a> was the keynote (or just
the first speaker) and gave an excellent argument for the importance of
documenting and was . an excellent speaker, as always. <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/talks.html#brandon-philips">Brandon Philips</a> had
a great talk on single page documentation that made solid sense to me. <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/talks.html#kevin-hale">Kevin Hale</a>
also had a very well presented talk on reaching out to your customers
and keeping communication open.</p>

<p>The writing and literary talks were different from what I&rsquo;m used to as
a programmer, but I found them quite refreshing. One talk that stood out was
from <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/talks.html#matthew-butterick-typography-for-docs">Matthew Butterick</a>, on the importance of having a succinct message when
writing. He then gave out free copies of his book <a href="http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/">&ldquo;Typography for Lawyers,&rdquo;</a>
which after finishing, is a very informative and succinct
reference on the technical elements of writing.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>

<p>Hopefully next year, I will have something to present. The organizers said they
were looking to hold the conference again next year and I would be very keen on
attending, Portland is a great venue. Thanks to <a href="http://conf.writethedocs.org/#crew">the Erics and Troy</a> for
a great conference.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
    <p>This year was my second PyCon and I wanted to share some thoughts from the
experience. Although it is quite a large event running well over a week,
I attended for just a few days and took away a good amount of information. The
two big themes I noticed, maybe just from the selection of talks I attended,
were Python 3 and IPython.</p>

<h3>Python 3</h3>

<p>Python 3 was originally slated to have something around a five-year
rollout, which would put us in 2013. Last year, I noticed a few talks for Python
3 and focus still on porting, but this year I felt Python 3 was being used as
the default in most talks. Many (most?) major libraries and tools seem to have
switched over to Python 3.3 and it seems like the community is moving on.  Jacob
Kaplan-Moss&rsquo;s talk on Django and Python 3 was pretty straightforward and useful.
With Django 1.5 now having Python 3 support, the work has moved to upgrading Django
libraries. The vibe to me is that most people have accepted and started using it
where possible.</p>

<h3>IPython Notebook</h3>

<p>The IPython Notebook was something just released last year
with 0.12, but this year, several people gave talks using the IPython Notebook
and I was very impressed. It seems like a very polished tool for sharing and
demonstrating Python code and I&rsquo;ve definitely started using more when hacking
around. The <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks">selection of available notebooks</a> is quite interesting.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>The vendor area was well laid out for wandering and meeting new
companies, while the lunch buffet seemed better organized this year. Everyone
also received a free Raspberry Pi this year, which I&rsquo;m still figuring out what
to do with, but am glad to have something fun to hack with. On the last day of
talks, many people were excited with the announcement of 20% female attendance
ratio, but that was dampened in the following days with the <a href="https://amandablumwords.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/3/">&ldquo;dongle&rdquo; harassment</a>
incident. In my experience, PyCon and Python is a very welcoming community and
I hope everyone can use better judgement in the future. PyCon 2014 will be
in Montreal and while that is quite far away from SF, I hope I can make it!</p>

Considering I&rsquo;m planning on sitting at this desk for the next ~14 months (which is actually quite a long time for me stay in one place), I wanted to ensure that it was ergonomically sound. My main guide was a pair of <a title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" target=_blank>Coding Horror</a> articles, a programmer blog from <span class=description>Jeff Atwood. They had been on my mind for awhile, but I didn&rsquo;t have the time or money until now to do something about them until now!</span></p> <h3>Proper Posture</h3> <p>For the amount of time I sit at my desk, I should care about the manner in how I sit there. <a title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000938.html" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000938.html" target=_blank>Computer Ergonomics</a> was the first article which I checked. Following the guidelines:</p> <ul> <li>I put 2 books under my iMac, raising the center of my monitor to be directly at my eye sight looking foward.</li> <li>Raised my chair, so that my belly button is elevated at the same level as my desktop.</li> <li>Pushed my iMac back, allowing my arms to fully rest on my desktop.</li> </ul> <p>After about 2-3 weeks of doing this, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s helped. I&rsquo;m already used to sitting at my desk for hours on end, but I feel less stressed maybe, less cramps while doing so now. Recommended advice I already follow is to get up every 20 minutes or so and wander around my apartment. Keep the blood flowing!</p> <h3>Twice As Good</h3> <p>The second article, <a title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000959.html" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000959.html" target=_blank>LCD Monitor Arms</a>, had been in my mind for awhile, but I didn&rsquo;t have the funds to support it. I&rsquo;ve had two LCDs screens available to me for a few years now and I would never go back. However, on my current setup, desk space is at a premium and I can&rsquo;t space items out as far as I would like. That means that positioning a 2nd LCD on the right hand side of my desk was interfering with my right handed mouse. The solution was a desktop mounted arm. <a rel="attachment wp-image-133" href="http://www.thebehrensventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_0080.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-133" title=img_0080 src="http://www.thebehrensventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_0080-450x337.jpg" alt="" width=450 height=337 /></a></p> <p>The Ergotron LX desk arm is awesome. I mounted my old 20&quot; LCD onto the arm and now I can free up the desk space beneath the LCD, along with position the LCD <em>exactly</em> where I would like it. It&rsquo;s not cheap, around $125 with tax for me, but a worthwhile investment for the time being. I&rsquo;m quite pleased with it.</p> <p>My desk situation is quite comfortable right now, although I will have to wait another year before I buy the Aeron. I would highly recommend to take sometime and evalute your own situation!</p> <p><a rel="attachment wp-image-133" href="http://www.thebehrensventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_0079.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-132" title=img_0079 src="http://www.thebehrensventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_0079-450x337.jpg" alt="" width=450 height=337 /></a></p> </span> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <div> <h4>Recent Articles</h4> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Jan 2017 »</span> <a href="/2017/01/08/hosting-with-dokku/">Hosting with Dokku</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>18 Sep 2016 »</span> <a href="/2016/09/18/testing-the-layers-of-your-application-at-pyconuk-2016/">Testing the Layers of Your Application at PyConUK 2016</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>21 Apr 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/04/21/upgrading-my-dotfiles-to-symlinks/">Upgrading My Dotfiles To Symlinks</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Feb 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/02/08/another-year-another-set-of-backups/">Another Year, Another Set Of Backups</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>02 Dec 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/12/02/practical-lessons-learned-from-testing/">Practical Lessons Learned From Testing</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>20 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/20/streaming-small-http-responses-with-python/">Streaming Small HTTP Responses with Python</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>03 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/03/an-exploration-in-selecting-things/">An Exploration In Selecting Things</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <p id=credits> Powered by <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. <br/> <br/> </p> </div> <div id=right> <div id=right-header> <a href="/"><h1>Ask the Relic</h1></a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>

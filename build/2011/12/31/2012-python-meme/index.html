For a good six months of this year, I was managing everything server-wise at my last job through Fabric and learned a good deal about it, <a href="/2011/02/17/dynamic-fabric-commands-for-managing-cloud-servers/">hacking in some features</a> and <a href="/2011/06/22/fabric-for-python-automation/">giving a presentation</a> on it at the local <a href="http://pghpython.org/">Pittsburgh users group</a>. It&rsquo;s great to be able to automate things and to have that ability in Python.</p> <h3>What new programming technique did you learn in 2011?</h3> <p>I can&rsquo;t think of a specific area I focused on, but overall: I&rsquo;ve broaden my knowledge of Python unit testing, deployment, and project packaging. I&rsquo;ve also ben diving deep into background processing with <a href="http://celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> lately, which really interests me.</p> <h3>What’s the name of the open source project you contributed the most in 2011? What did you do?</h3> <p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think I have contributed back too much. <a href="https://github.com/askedrelic/journal">Journal</a>, a Python script for keeping a CLI journal, was probably my most complete project for the year, but I haven&rsquo;t been hacking on it recently. Reaching out more via Github and interacting more with other developers is my goal for next year.</p> <h3>What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2011?</h3> <p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a>. After moving to San Francisco, getting a job via the monthly job threads, and meeting up with people from the site, I&rsquo;ve really come to enjoy the dialogue available on programming and Python.</p> <h3>What are the three top things you want to learn in 2012?</h3> <ul> <li>Logging, metrics, and monitoring. Or applying the latest techniques and practices in production: using JSON for logged messages, realtime monitoring and alerting, longterm storage, indexing, and searching.</li> <li>A new language. I know a great deal about Python, but it&rsquo;s time to start fresh. Haskell has always been high on my list, but I&rsquo;ve never set specific goals and forced myself to start anything. Time to change that.</li> <li>More Python? I&rsquo;ve been diving into packaging once again, but maybe I should try and figure out how to help fix what I don&rsquo;t like about Python. I&rsquo;m looking forward to attending PyCon US 2012 this year, hoping to get some great ideas.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the top software, app or lib you wish someone would write in 2012?</h3> <p>Unify/fix Python packaging? More Python3 releases? I still need to convert all my scripts to Python3. I have a bunch of Github improvements I&rsquo;d love see happen, but maybe with the v3 API I can hack them in myself.</p> <p>Want to do your own list?

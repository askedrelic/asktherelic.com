Most GUI text editors have a direct &ldquo;one window to one file&rdquo; correlation. You can open multiple documents and until they are saved as disk files, they just exist on screen. Most times when I&rsquo;m using Vim, there is only one window open, but I am working on multiple files and switching between them quickly, which is where buffers come in.</p> <p>In Vim, a buffer represents a chunk of text you are working on. A buffer can be a file or it can be an unsaved chunk of text. When you do a <code class=prettyprint>:split</code> on a single window, you have two views of the same buffer, or you can open up another file and have two buffers visible. If you open up a third file and buffer, your previous buffer will become a hidden buffer, which is where I think most confusion comes from. Every file you open becomes a new buffer. If you make changes on a file and switch to a new buffer, you have changes on a hidden buffer, which could become lost if you close Vim before you save that buffer. It&rsquo;s very easy and useful to have multiple buffers and split windows open, but keeping track of those buffers is important.</p> <h3>Managing Your Buffers</h3> <p><code class=prettyprint>:buffers</code> or <code class=prettyprint>:ls</code> is the main command to see all buffers. <code class=prettyprint>:bn</code> or <code class=prettyprint>:bp</code> is buffer next/previous to switch between them. Every buffer has a number, so <code class=prettyprint>:buffer 1</code> will switch to buffer #1. But once you move to having a dozen buffers open, it becomes harder to manage. There are <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Easier_buffer_switching">scripts</a> to help with this. Several plugins offer an onscreen view of all open buffers, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42" title=bufexplorer>bufexplorer</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=159" title=minibufexplorer>minibufexplorer</a> and add shortcut keys to make switching buffers easier, but I have never found that on screen display necessary.</p> <p><span class=aligncenter> <img src="/pic/minibuf.png" alt=minibufexplorer /> </span></p> <h3>My Old: FuzzyFinder</h3> <p>I&rsquo;ve grown used to switching buffers by partial name search or most recently used (MRU) order. Simplifying that has process has been my goal in searching for a buffer plugin. <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984" title=FuzzyFinder>FuzzyFinder</a> solved both of those problems well.</p> <p><span class=aligncenter> <img src="/pic/ffbuffer.png" alt="FuzzyFinder Buffer mode"/> </span></p> <p>FuzzyFinder is a big plugin, offering fuzzy text searching capabilities for pretty much everything you can search for in Vim, but its buffer mode is quite useful. It&rsquo;s a drop down list, with last accessed time displayed and sorted by MRU. You can use <code class=prettyprint>CTRL+N</code> or <code class=prettyprint>CTRL+P</code> and a cursor to select the top few items easily. You can type any partial buffer name to filter the list. I&rsquo;ve used FF for many years, but have found it slow at times and a bit quirky when closing/deleting the windows it creates. Therefore, I&rsquo;ve moved onto Lusty. </p> <h3>My New: LustyJuggler</h3> <p>My current choice is the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1890" title=LustyExplorer>LustyExplorer</a> plugin and its compliment, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2050" title=LustyJuggler>LustyJuggler</a>. LustyExplorer offers a few other file opening capabilities which I will explore in another post, but its buffer mode is top notch. Display of all open buffers, order by MRU, with fuzzy text filtering capabilities and Tab to select. Simple and quick.</p> <p><span class=aligncenter> <img src="/pic/lustybuffer.png" alt=LustyBuffer /> </span></p> <p>Vim is all about saving key strokes, so why even type out a partial filename? LustyJuggler allows you to &ldquo;juggle&rdquo; between open buffers, showing the last 9 used buffers with simple select using the 1-9 number keys or the <code class=prettyprint>asdfghjkl</code> row of keys, for qwerty keyboard users.</p> <p><span class=aligncenter> <img src="/pic/lustyjuggler.png" alt=LustyJuggler /> </span></p> <p>Finally, one of the new features I&rsquo;m still learning to use is BufferGrep: very quick grep of all open buffers.</p> <p><span class=aligncenter> <img src="/pic/lustygrep.png" alt=LustyBufferGrep /> </span></p> <p>I plan to cover LustyExplorer more in the future, but for now, it has been a quite useful and clean plugin. Once you have begun to get a better grasp over your buffers, you can move to tabs and vertical split windows and having access to your source code in many different ways.

While running a small startup exploring a business market, trying new features was a daily or weekly affair; you have to make tradeoffs with code quality, feature set, or speed of delivery. Code testing, especially in quantity of unit tests, had been something I usually traded for speed of delivery. If I can deliver a feature that looks correct from a high-level business perspective, then the code is probably correct based upon my experience with the programming language. However, no programmer is perfect and preparing for failure is a good idea.</p> <h3>Basic Testing</h3> <p>Testing can be approached from many different ways, with different goals. At the unit test level, you are essentially testing your API:</p> <ul> <li>is the API easy to use; how hard is the code to test (a great smell for bad code)</li> <li>did I really build what I wanted to build</li> <li>is it extensible; how many dependencies does the code have</li> </ul> <p>This what many developers think tests are. I have always felt these were important from an academic standpoint, but definitely never gave them their due respect. Unit tests are a great way to explore your code and reflect whether it still makes sense on a second glance. No matter how trivial or simple the code may be, having the ability to change your mind repeatably, with verified results, is useful.</p> <p>Moving to a higher level, functional or system tests are good to determine if 3rd-party libraries and your application as a whole is working correctly, and usually where I have spent much of my time from a return on time investment. Either the system works or it doesn&rsquo;t and this can be traced down quickly. This is something I have begun to focus less on, due to getting better gains from improved unit testing. This is basically the debate over <a href="http://superprofundo.com/2010/12/13/top-down-and-bottom-up-pros-and-cons/">top-down versus bottom-up</a> design and I think testing at both ends of the spectrum is important.</p> <h3>Communicating The Code</h3> <p>This point has been one of the bigger breakthroughs I&rsquo;ve made: tests communicate the spec. When I&rsquo;m building a feature, I usually iteratively write code until I say it works. I&rsquo;m continually running the code and I am doing the evaluating of the output to determine that the computer is generating correct output. But moving that evaluation step into into code and automating is a big, very useful, step. This is essentially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-driven_development">BDD</a>; letting business people write a code spec and having to match that spec.</p> <p>Once a feature has been communicated into a code spec, changing that feature later becomes a migration; not having to start from scratch to ensure all my assumptions still work with subtle changes.</p> <p>As my team has gotten larger, being able to say my code does something and then have a test to prove it helps with async communication and increases the speed of integration. Having a second source of code truth keeps everyone on the same page about what the code is doing and helps smooth the merge process.</p> <p>For an open source project, having public tests helps show your concern for code quality and is an easy way for knowledgeable developers to jump into your code: how do I use your code? Well, I can always check out the tests because they better work. Across many projects, documentation is pretty rare or of poor quality. Both tests and documentation are important for your project, but while documentation fades with time, test code has a very binary usefulness.</p> <h3>Check Yo Self Before You Wreck Yo Self</h3> <p>Coming from doing most of my coding in Python and dynamic languages, this concern may not be as important in static languages like C#/Java, but I think it is still important.</p> <p>Tests help verify your assumptions. Returning to my original point, failure will happen and trying to plan for is a much better solution than waiting until it happens. Dynamic typing makes it faster to write code and but pushes many errors to become runtime errors. The number of times I&rsquo;ve run into date/time/datetime conversion errors in Python has definitely pushed me to test more. I can assume what code is doing all day long, until I actually test it and find that one instance when the API does something you weren&rsquo;t expecting. Even assuming that you really understand dates or <a href="http://blog.counsyl.com/2013/09/27/true-facts-about-time-zones/" title="Seriously, what the hell">timezones</a> is often incorrect.</p> <p>When you run into a new problem, having a test environment setup that you can easily jump into will save time and get you fixing things quicker. The more you invest in the test environment, the easier it is to solve new types of problems and quickly diagnose problems when they arise.</p> <h3>In Closing</h3> <p>How much to test, what areas to test, what type of testing to use: these questions are always up for debate. Any level of testing is good and you can probably improve. In the world of <a href="http://github.com/askedrelic/">GitHub</a>, you rarely code &ldquo;alone&rdquo;; someone will always read your code and making it easier for them to read and analyze is a good thing. Finally, double checking yourself is a good thing. Testing is an investment, sometimes the return may take awhile to surface, but improving your testing ability is one step to becoming a better programmer.</p> </span> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <div> <h4>Recent Articles</h4> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Jan 2017 »</span> <a href="/2017/01/08/hosting-with-dokku/">Hosting with Dokku</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>18 Sep 2016 »</span> <a href="/2016/09/18/testing-the-layers-of-your-application-at-pyconuk-2016/">Testing the Layers of Your Application at PyConUK 2016</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>21 Apr 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/04/21/upgrading-my-dotfiles-to-symlinks/">Upgrading My Dotfiles To Symlinks</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Feb 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/02/08/another-year-another-set-of-backups/">Another Year, Another Set Of Backups</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>02 Dec 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/12/02/practical-lessons-learned-from-testing/">Practical Lessons Learned From Testing</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>20 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/20/streaming-small-http-responses-with-python/">Streaming Small HTTP Responses with Python</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>03 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/03/an-exploration-in-selecting-things/">An Exploration In Selecting Things</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <p id=credits> Powered by <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. <br/> <br/> </p> </div> <div id=right> <div id=right-header> <a href="/"><h1>Ask the Relic</h1></a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <script>

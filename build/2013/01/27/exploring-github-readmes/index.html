Code is just one part of a project, first impressions matter, and especially when deciding to add a dependency to your project, you want to judge a project on many different metrics.</p> <p>READMEs are a big first impression. They can summarize your project, show quick getting started documentation, licensing information, and are a good metric about the overall state of your project. GitHub has pushed especially hard for developers to use READMEs, in trying to make open source projects more digestible to everyone.</p> <p>I was recently wondering about the state of READMEs in GitHub and since it&rsquo;s so easy to parse things out of GitHub, I started hacking today and found some quick numbers.</p> <h3>Getting Started</h3> <p>First, I wanted a good set of data. GitHub keeps a <a href="https://github.com/repositories">list of popular repos</a> but it&rsquo;s not part of the v3 API as far as I could see. I couldn&rsquo;t find any easy list of the 1000 or so Top Starred GitHub Repos, so I parsed out the top 20 watched repos from each of the 90 languages that Github tracks and decide to call that a good list.</p> <p>Here is the code using Requests plus shitty regex</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/4651871.js"></script> <h3>Parsing Markdown</h3> <p>With a list of &ldquo;popular&rdquo; repos (1784 count), I used the GitHub API to determine whether a repo had a README and then started parsing out the README type.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/4651896.js"></script> <h3>Initial Results</h3> <p>From the 1784 repos, only 15% (278) don&rsquo;t have any README!</p> <p>Of the 85% (1505) with READMEs, about 58% (884) are specifically Markdown format. I&rsquo;m still figuring out the rest, they are either txt format or no format.</p> <p>The average README byte size is 3455, with median of 1753.</p> <p>Here is a CSV of repos with URLS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/4651905">https://gist.github.com/4651905</a></p> <p>Here is the CSV of repos from which this initial information was estimated: <a href="https://gist.github.com/4651912">https://gist.github.com/4651912</a></p> <h3>Going Forward</h3> <p>My next goal is to parse out headers and identify README structure and content; what percentage of repos have a license in their README, have a quick change log, have example docs, or what the average structure of a README is.</p> <p>All code is going to live at <a href="https://github.com/askedrelic/github_introspection">https://github.com/askedrelic/github_introspection</a>, it&rsquo;s a mess of stuff pulled from IPython right now, but will improve (and get a better README too!).</p> <p>Ideally, I would like to be able to parse out a suggested header index and build out a README generator. By analyzing the community of popular repos, popular standards can be identified.</p> <p>Open source project organization has always been a big interest to me, with the goal of making my projects more palatable and in trying to improve the overall quality of all open source projects.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/jcarbaugh/lice">Lice</a> is a similar tool for auto generating license information. <a href="https://github.com/jeromegn/DocumentUp">DocumentUp</a> is another great tool to generate a much more readable README format for your repo, but I would love to have the README be a more useful and structured piece of information for a project.</p> </span> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <div> <h4>Recent Articles</h4> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>21 Apr 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/04/21/upgrading-my-dotfiles-to-symlinks/">Upgrading My Dotfiles To Symlinks</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Feb 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/02/08/another-year-another-set-of-backups/">Another Year, Another Set Of Backups</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>02 Dec 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/12/02/practical-lessons-learned-from-testing/">Practical Lessons Learned From Testing</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>20 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/20/streaming-small-http-responses-with-python/">Streaming Small HTTP Responses with Python</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>03 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/03/an-exploration-in-selecting-things/">An Exploration In Selecting Things</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>22 Aug 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/08/22/the-birthday-surprise/">The Birthday Surprise</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>05 Aug 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/08/05/a-newer-branch/">A Newer Branch</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <p id=credits> Powered by <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. <br/> <br/> </p> </div> <div id=right> <div id=right-header> <a href="/"><h1>Ask the Relic</h1></a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <script>

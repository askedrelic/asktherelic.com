I have gotten some of my best ideas recently from conferences, traveling to PyCon in Santa Clara and this past weekend, Write the Docs in Portland.</p> <h3>The What</h3> <p><a href="http://conf.writethedocs.org/">Write the Docs</a> is a conference organized to talk about documentation, for those who document, organize, and share information. It originated as a crazy idea over beers, but the founders kept investigating and figured out how they could actually make a conference happen. I found out about it via Hacker News and decided to sign up as a cheap and fun trip to Portland.</p> <p>The conference was on a Monday/Tuesday. I fly up from San Francisco the Saturday before and hung out for the weekend. On Sunday, there was a meet and greet hike, followed by a meet and greet beer bash. I had a great time: from meeting so many cool people, to getting exposed to many different new ideas about why or how to write. The conference was held in a theatre with a single track of talks and it was a great format to be able to sit back and focus on a talk, without having to worry about missing anything.</p> <h3>The Talks</h3> <p>If anything, there were too many great talks to process in two short days, but I think everyone managed. There seemed to be a good fifty/fifty mix of programmers to technical writers. <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/talks.html#kenneth-reitz">Kenneth Reitz</a> was the keynote (or just the first speaker) and gave an excellent argument for the importance of documenting and was . an excellent speaker, as always. <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/talks.html#brandon-philips">Brandon Philips</a> had a great talk on single page documentation that made solid sense to me. <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/talks.html#kevin-hale">Kevin Hale</a> also had a very well presented talk on reaching out to your customers and keeping communication open.</p> <p>The writing and literary talks were different from what I&rsquo;m used to as a programmer, but I found them quite refreshing. One talk that stood out was from <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/talks.html#matthew-butterick-typography-for-docs">Matthew Butterick</a>, on the importance of having a succinct message when writing. He then gave out free copies of his book <a href="http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/">&ldquo;Typography for Lawyers,&rdquo;</a> which after finishing, is a very informative and succinct reference on the technical elements of writing.</p> <h3>The Future</h3> <p>Hopefully next year, I will have something to present. The organizers said they were looking to hold the conference again next year and I would be very keen on attending, Portland is a great venue. Thanks to <a href="http://conf.writethedocs.org/#crew">the Erics and Troy</a> for a great conference.</p> </span> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <div> <h4>Recent Articles</h4> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Jan 2017 »</span> <a href="/2017/01/08/hosting-with-dokku/">Hosting with Dokku</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>18 Sep 2016 »</span> <a href="/2016/09/18/testing-the-layers-of-your-application-at-pyconuk-2016/">Testing the Layers of Your Application at PyConUK 2016</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>21 Apr 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/04/21/upgrading-my-dotfiles-to-symlinks/">Upgrading My Dotfiles To Symlinks</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Feb 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/02/08/another-year-another-set-of-backups/">Another Year, Another Set Of Backups</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>02 Dec 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/12/02/practical-lessons-learned-from-testing/">Practical Lessons Learned From Testing</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>20 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/20/streaming-small-http-responses-with-python/">Streaming Small HTTP Responses with Python</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>03 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/03/an-exploration-in-selecting-things/">An Exploration In Selecting Things</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <p id=credits> Powered by <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. <br/> <br/> </p> </div> <div id=right> <div id=right-header> <a href="/"><h1>Ask the Relic</h1></a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>

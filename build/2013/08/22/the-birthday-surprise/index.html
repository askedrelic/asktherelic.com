A birthday is generally always a reason to celebrate, but this birthday, my <a href="http://officialblog.yelp.com/2013/07/welcoming-seatme-to-yelp.html">startup was acquired by Yelp</a> several days beforehand, which makes this birthday extra special!</p> <p>Startups are hard work. Finding a market, building a product, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">growing that product</a>, figuring out which corners to cut, or not cut; it&rsquo;s all hard work, even though some may make it look easy. I was lucky to be one of the early engineers at SeatMe and am proud of the team and product we helped build, while learning some new things along the way. Yelp is a great company with a great culture and I&rsquo;m looking forward now to continuing to grow the product. </p> <p>While it was a busy week with that announcement, there was still time to reflect and evaluate the last year. I think it&rsquo;s good to have milestones and evaluate your progress along the way. I don&rsquo;t mean that life is a race, but I do find value in judging where I am in life. <a href="http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/george-saunderss-advice-to-graduates/">Am I a better person than last year?</a> Have I learned new skills? What skills do I want to learn? <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178211966454607.html">How have I helped others?</a> These may seem like platitudes, but I genuinely hope to improve myself year over year.</p> <p>Here&rsquo;s to a good next year.</p> </span> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <div> <h4>Recent Articles</h4> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Jan 2017 »</span> <a href="/2017/01/08/hosting-with-dokku/">Hosting with Dokku</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>18 Sep 2016 »</span> <a href="/2016/09/18/testing-the-layers-of-your-application-at-pyconuk-2016/">Testing the Layers of Your Application at PyConUK 2016</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>21 Apr 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/04/21/upgrading-my-dotfiles-to-symlinks/">Upgrading My Dotfiles To Symlinks</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Feb 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/02/08/another-year-another-set-of-backups/">Another Year, Another Set Of Backups</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>02 Dec 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/12/02/practical-lessons-learned-from-testing/">Practical Lessons Learned From Testing</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>20 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/20/streaming-small-http-responses-with-python/">Streaming Small HTTP Responses with Python</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>03 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/03/an-exploration-in-selecting-things/">An Exploration In Selecting Things</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <p id=credits> Powered by <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. <br/> <br/> </p> </div> <div id=right> <div id=right-header> <a href="/"><h1>Ask the Relic</h1></a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>

I&rsquo;ve been very pleased with easily keeping my OSX system up to date since it was released; no more Fink/MacPorts, it&rsquo;s automatable, it just works (well, as long as you keep installing the latest XCode or OSX Command Line Tools).</p> <p><em>You are using Homebrew to install and update all your programs, right? If not, checkout the <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homepage</a> now.</em></p> <p>However, when just following the <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">Homebrew repo</a> on GitHub, I think keeping up to date with what is &ldquo;new&rdquo; with Homebrew has always been hard. Maybe I haven&rsquo;t paid enough attention or read enough of the man pages.</p> <p>So here is an overview of a bunch of new features I found out about recently, including the ability to install GUI OSX applications, via <a href="https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask">Cask</a>:</p> <h3>Outdated</h3> <p>Despite what I just said about staying up to date, I upgrade specific packages by choice. <code class=prettyprint>brew update</code> will get you the latest install scripts, <code class=prettyprint>brew oudated</code> will show what versions have changed. For some programs; PostgreSQL, there is associated data that has to be migrated and sometimes I don&rsquo;t want to upgrade. I usually <code class=prettyprint>brew upgrade &lt;package&gt;</code> or multiple packages at once, once I find they are outdated.</p> <h3>Versions</h3> <p>Along the same lines, want to install an old version of a package?</p> <p>Want to find out which versions there are? <code class=prettyprint>brew versions &lt;package&gt;</code> will show the previous versions and allow you to checkout the install script for a previous version.</p> <h3>Install via URL/local file</h3> <p>Found a new install script for a cool package Github, want to test it out quickly? Copy the raw package URL from Github and <code class=prettyprint>brew install https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/raw/master/Library/Formula/ace.rb</code></p> <p>Or install via local absolute file paths, if you want to download the script and then edit it.</p> <p>(This was added with <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-0.8">Homebrew 0.8</a> about 18 months ago</p> <h3>Taps</h3> <p>Longterm, you probably don&rsquo;t want to have a bunch of packages installed from random urls or old versions of install scripts checked out in your Homebrew repo. Also, for the Homebrew maintainers, I guess managing one huge repo of all packages became more difficult as Homebrew grew more popular.</p> <p>Taps allow you have to setup multiple package repos.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions">Versions</a> provides multiple versions of existing packages; python24, python25, python 26. Homebrew official python is only 2.7.3 </li> <li><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes">Dupes</a> has dupes of OSX system packages </li> <li><a href="https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php">PHP</a> is a bunch of scripts for making latest PHP easier to install. Overall, I gave up PHP development on OSX and moved to Linux VMs, but maybe there is hope!</li> </ul> <p>Setting up a private repo for your own scripts or company isn&rsquo;t that hard either, if you wanted to vendor fork a bunch of packages and make use of Homebrew.</p> <p>Once you&rsquo;ve added a Tap, <code class=prettyprint>brew search</code> and <code class=prettyprint>brew install</code> automatically check that repo for packages. <code class=prettyprint>brew update</code> will check all Taps for updates as well.</p> <p>Want to see your installed Taps? </p> <div class=highlight><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>ls `brew --prefix`/Library/Taps
</code></pre></div> <p>(This was added with <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-0.9">Homebrew 0.9</a> about 9 months ago</p> <h3>Cask</h3> <p><a href="https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask">Cask</a> is something I just found today, after trying to replicate it&rsquo;s functionality in Homebrew. Homebrew is great for system packages, but why not GUI apps and regular OSX programs? Installing downloaded zip/dmg files is what Cask does.</p> <p>Add the Cask repo <code class=prettyprint>brew tap phinze/homebrew-cask</code> and install it to Homebrew <code class=prettyprint>brew install brew-cask</code></p> <p>Now install Google Chrome, Spotify, Sparrow, iTerm2 in one line <code class=prettyprint>brew cask install google-chrome spotify sparrow iterm2</code> and those apps are now installed and usable.</p> <p>I just started using this, I have no clue how Sparkle or apps that auto-update themself work with this, but I still think it&rsquo;s a great idea. The integration isn&rsquo;t great with Homebrew right now; you have to search Cask apps separately, <code class=prettyprint>brew cask search</code>, but hopefully that will improve in the future.</p> <p>If you use Alfred and wonder why your newly installed apps aren&rsquo;t showing in Alfred, read the Cask README <a href="https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask#alfred-integration">to the bottom</a></p> <h3>External Commands</h3> <p>Coincidentally, I didn&rsquo;t realize the Tap and Cask commands were mostly done via Homebrew&rsquo;s external command support, ala git. See more <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/External-Commands">here</a>.</p> <p>To see the currently (probably default) set of available commands </p> <div class=highlight><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>ls `brew --repository`/Library/Contributions/cmd
</code></pre></div> <h3>Services</h3> <p>This is one of the coolest commands I haven&rsquo;t been using: brew managed wrapper around launchctl. <code class=prettyprint>brew services</code> to find out more.</p> <p>Next time you upgrade redis and get that unload/load message, unload redis, copy the latest launch plist, and then: <code class=prettyprint>brew services redis start</code>. You can <code class=prettyprint>brew services list</code> to see all of your Homebrew services started under services, no launchctl tinkering.</p> <p>Happy brewing!</p> </span> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <div> <h4>Recent Articles</h4> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Jan 2017 »</span> <a href="/2017/01/08/hosting-with-dokku/">Hosting with Dokku</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>18 Sep 2016 »</span> <a href="/2016/09/18/testing-the-layers-of-your-application-at-pyconuk-2016/">Testing the Layers of Your Application at PyConUK 2016</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>21 Apr 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/04/21/upgrading-my-dotfiles-to-symlinks/">Upgrading My Dotfiles To Symlinks</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>08 Feb 2014 »</span> <a href="/2014/02/08/another-year-another-set-of-backups/">Another Year, Another Set Of Backups</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>02 Dec 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/12/02/practical-lessons-learned-from-testing/">Practical Lessons Learned From Testing</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>20 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/20/streaming-small-http-responses-with-python/">Streaming Small HTTP Responses with Python</a> </div> <div class="post frontpage"> <span class=linkdate>03 Nov 2013 »</span> <a href="/2013/11/03/an-exploration-in-selecting-things/">An Exploration In Selecting Things</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=hr></div> <p id=credits> Powered by <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. <br/> <br/> </p> </div> <div id=right> <div id=right-header> <a href="/"><h1>Ask the Relic</h1></a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>

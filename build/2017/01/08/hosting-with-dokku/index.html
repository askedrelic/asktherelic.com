Without using too many acronyms, it&rsquo;s an app management tool built around Docker. I started <a href="/2011/11/05/unix-style-cron-on-heroku-s-cedar-stack/">using Heroku</a> back in 2011, when they added support for Python. The simple command line interface for app deployment and free CPU time was a great selling point.</p> <p>But as costs lowered for servers and with a personal desire to control more of my own tools, for privacy and security reasons, the option to run my own became really interesting.</p> <h3>Some History</h3> <p>There have been three major versions of my blog, with different goals at different times (although using three different programming languages wasn&rsquo;t the goal, just a coincidence):</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, PHP, 2006 - 2010ish</li> <li><a href="http://www.blogofile.com/">Blogofile</a>, Python, 2010 - 2013</li> <li><a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>, Ruby, 2013 - present</li> </ul> <p>Middleman is still currently being used to <a href="/2013/08/05/a-newer-branch/">generate this blog as a static website</a>, but now with Dokku, it can be deployed and updated via git push, which is really easy and convenient!</p> <h3>Dokku Details</h3> <p>Docker is new hotness that makes deploying code really easy, but it’s still a very manual tool, which is where Dokku comes in. <a href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/">Dokku</a> controls Docker and makes it easy to deploy whole applications; connecting databases, caching servers, or multiple servers together easily. It has a a simple command line interface and support for plugins.</p> <p>So what this means to me:</p> <ul> <li>It’s easier to deploy a new server now. Dokku manages app configs, so I closer to having a <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 factor app</a>, where configuration is part of the environment (server) and not part of the app. This makes it easier to keep my source code open.</li> <li>I can use plugins to setup SSL or databases correctly. The <a href="https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a> plugin is really easy to use and makes an already easy process foolproof. I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres">PostgreSQL</a> but I still have some legacy LAMP apps I&rsquo;m running that need <a href="https://github.com/dokku/dokku-mysql">MySQL</a>. These plugins make it so easy to boot a database and have it backed up automatically to S3. More things are automated, hopefully leaving more time to create new things.</li> <li>Best practices and examples are easily shared. The nginx config that is running this blog comes from <a href="https://github.com/dokku/buildpack-nginx">a github fork</a>, that has continued to be improved overtime.</li> </ul> <p>So I recommend Dokku if you are interested in running webapps easily and controlling your server.

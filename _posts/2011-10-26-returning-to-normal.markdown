The last few months have been a bit hectic: a few weeks traveling through NYC
and DC, a new job in San Francisco, a cross country drive, and a few apartment
moves. Thankfully, my life has finally reached the point where I am comfortable
again and can start coding and writing in peace. My new job has kept me
quite busy, but what little free time I find, I try and make good use of.

I found an article through HackerNews recently that, while quite old, still
seemed quite relevent and impressed me greatly: ["You and Your Research,"][1] a
transcription of a talk given by Richard Hamming in 1986, the year I was born.

Of the many great quotes and ideas in his talk, this stood out to me:

`"You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it"`

That is the best way to describe my goal for this blog, along with the code in
my github repos. It's time to accomplish great things.

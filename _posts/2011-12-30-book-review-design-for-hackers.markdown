[Design For Hackers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119998956/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=asktherelic-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1119998956)  
David Kadavy  
ISBN: 1119998956

###Whatâ€™s The Point?

Design, layout, fonts, and color theory for websites and web applications.
Kadavy covers all the main points of design, how design affects how we use
things, and through understanding your design decisions, how you can make
better decisions.

###How Was It?

A useful and interesting read! The hacker in me likes well organized and
straightforward things. Each of the main elements of design were given a
chapter and covered thoroughly: what they are, how they work and why they exist
in a historical context. There were plenty of visual examples that were current
and useful.

Typography and fonts were given special preference, given the importance and
history, and a practical guide for using them in most situations was given in
an appendix.

###Who Should Read It?

Programmers and hackers new to the topic. As an overall guide to design, it's a
great starting point and covers the bases, but is not a detailed guide on any
topic.

###Notes:

I met the author through a [GrubWithUs](http://www.grubwithus.com/) group meal.
He was using group meals as a kind of book tour and it was an interesting
experience to eat and discuss the book together! I also got my copy signed!

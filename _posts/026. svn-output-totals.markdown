title: SVN Line Output Totals
---
I'm working in a group project currently and annoyed at the lack of output by my teammates. Wanting hard metrics of how awesome I am and how awesome they aren't, I wrote this command up.

$$code(lang=sh,linenums=true)
svn ls -R | egrep -v -e "/$" | xargs svn blame | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

Output:
    2038 matt
    433 john
    263 ryan
    186 alice
    167 bob
$$/code

This command will print an full repository listing of all files, remove the directories, run svn blame on each individual file, and tally the resulting line counts. It seems quite slow, depending on your repository location, because blame must hit the server for each individual file. You can remove the -R on the first part to print out the tallies for just the current directory.

I posted this over at <a title="www.commandlinefu.com" href="http://www.commandlinefu.com">commandlinefu.com</a> as well for feedback, so check <a title="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/2787/prints-total-line-count-contribution-per-user-for-an-svn-repository" href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/2787/prints-total-line-count-contribution-per-user-for-an-svn-repository" target="_blank">here</a> for possible helpful commentary of the command! If you haven't been to commandlinefu before, definitely check it out for some great one-liner-commands!

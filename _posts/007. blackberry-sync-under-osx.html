title: Blackberry Sync under OSX
---
<p>The state of affairs in OSX with Blackberries is pretty sad. RIM offers a free program called <a href="http://www.pocketmac.net/">PocketMac</a>, which amazingly works, but sucks very badly. It hasn't been updated in a long time and is not a Universal binary.</p>

<p><p>As part of my organizational work, I'm getting my contacts all in sync with Address Book in OSX, then dumping them to Gmail and my Blackberry. I have a PC with the RIM syncing software, which works fine and is a well developed piece of software, but i don't want to add an extra middle man to my syncing.</p>
<p>Overall, the software has a shitty installer, terrible Mac interface, slow performance, and lack of options and documentation. However, it does seem to work. I tried just doing a 1-way with my contacts, dumping them on the Blackberry, and syncing my Notes on the Blackberry to Stickies on OSX.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contacts sync 1-way fine, but it is a complete 1-way sync. It deletes all contacts on the Blackberry first, then overwrites your contacts. I have to try a 2-way sync, but I'm cautious because I don't want the Blackberry deleting info on the Address Book.</li>
    <li>Notes lose their title, but they transfer fine to Stickies. 2-way sync works fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm keeping it simple and not gonna try Calendar sync or anything. Overall, this is a very negative review, but I can't complain too much because it <strong>does</strong> work. Oh well.</p></p>

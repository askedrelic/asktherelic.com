title: Dual Monitors Done Right
---
After getting back to school and settling in, I put some serious thought into my current desk setup. Considering I'm planning on sitting at this desk for the next ~14 months (which is actually quite a long time for me stay in one place), I wanted to ensure that it was ergonomically sound. My main guide was a pair of <a title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" target="_blank">Coding Horror</a> articles, a programmer blog from <span class="description">Jeff Atwood. They had been on my mind for awhile, but I didn't have the time or money until now to do something about them until now!</span>
<h3>Proper Posture</h3>
For the amount of time I sit at my desk, I should care about the manner in how I sit there. <a title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000938.html" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000938.html" target="_blank">Computer Ergonomics</a> was the first article which I checked. Following the guidelines:
<ul>
	<li>I put 2 books under my iMac, raising the center of my monitor to be directly at my eye sight looking foward.</li>
	<li>Raised my chair, so that my belly button is elevated at the same level as my desktop.</li>
	<li>Pushed my iMac back, allowing my arms to fully rest on my desktop.</li>
</ul>
After about 2-3 weeks of doing this, I'd say it's helped. I'm already used to sitting at my desk for hours on end, but I feel less stressed maybe, less cramps while doing so now. Recommended advice I already follow is to get up every 20 minutes or so and wander around my apartment. Keep the blood flowing!
<h3>Twice As Good</h3>
The second article, <a title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000959.html" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000959.html" target="_blank">LCD Monitor Arms</a>, had been in my mind for awhile, but I didn't have the funds to support it. I've had two LCDs screens available to me for a few years now and I would never go back. However, on my current setup, desk space is at a premium and I can't space items out as far as I would like. That means that positioning a 2nd LCD on the right hand side of my desk was interfering with my right handed mouse. The solution was a desktop mounted arm.

The Ergotron LX desk arm is awesome. I mounted my old 20" LCD onto the arm and now I can free up the desk space beneath the LCD, along with position the LCD <em>exactly</em> where I would like it. It's not cheap, around $125 with tax for me, but a worthwhile investment for the time being. I'm quite pleased with it.

My desk situation is quite comfortable right now, although I will have to wait another year before I buy the Aeron. I would highly recommend to take sometime and evalute your own situation!

There is definite value to moving where you work and frequently changing your
perspective on your work, when you are looking for ideas. I have gotten some of
my best ideas recently from conferences, traveling to PyCon in Santa Clara and
this past weekend, Write the Docs in Portland.

### The What

[Write the Docs][1] is a conference organized to talk about documentation, for
those who document, organize, and share information. It originated as a crazy
idea over beers, but the founders kept investigating and figured out how they
could actually make a conference happen. I found out about it via Hacker News
and decided to sign up as a cheap and fun trip to Portland.

The conference was on a Monday/Tuesday. I fly up from San Francisco the Saturday
before and hung out for the weekend. On Sunday, there was a meet and greet hike,
followed by a meet and greet beer bash. I had a great time: from meeting so many
cool people, to getting exposed to many different new ideas about why or how to
write. The conference was held in a theatre with a single track of talks and it
was a great format to be able to sit back and focus on a talk, without having to
worry about missing anything.

### The Talks

If anything, there were too many great talks to process in two short days, but
I think everyone managed. There seemed to be a good fifty/fifty mix of
programmers to technical writers. [Kenneth Reitz][2] was the keynote (or just
the first speaker) and gave an excellent argument for the importance of
documenting and was . an excellent speaker, as always. [Brandon Philips][3] had
a great talk on single page documentation that made solid sense to me. [Kevin Hale][4]
also had a very well presented talk on reaching out to your customers
and keeping communication open.

The writing and literary talks were different from what I'm used to as
a programmer, but I found them quite refreshing. One talk that stood out was
from [Matthew Butterick][5], on the importance of having a succinct message when
writing. He then gave out free copies of his book ["Typography for Lawyers,"][6]
which after finishing, is a very informative and succinct
reference on the technical elements of writing.

### The Future

Hopefully next year, I will have something to present. The organizers said they
were looking to hold the conference again next year and I would be very keen on
attending, Portland is a great venue. Thanks to [the Erics and Troy][7] for
a great conference.

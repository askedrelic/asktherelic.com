title: Google IO 2008 Swag
---

I attended Google IO over the past 2 days, chronicling the event on [my
Twitter][1] and [Flickr pages][2]. I'm incredibly tired currently, barely
running off coffee and my thoughts are a mess so I will wait until this weekend
to post my thoughts, but quickly: it was an excellent event, well run with great
food and great ideas all around. Here's a shot of my swag below.

title: Year One At A Startup
draft: false
---

September was recently my first year at SeatMe, along with my first full year
living in San Francisco. It's been a great year as a programmer, doing some
awesome things at a startup that I love, and for life in general, moving closer
to many friends in the area. As part of this milestone, I wanted to reflect on
what has been accomplished and things I've learned along the way.

###The Big Picture

Something I attribute to growing older and more experienced is being able see
the horizon much easier. There is always the day to day and small details to
worry about, but through GTD and getting better at scheduling my life, I can
always look at my goals for next week, next month, or six months from now.
I have never thought of myself as much of a "detail oriented" person, but the
more I track and organize my life, the easier it has become to achieve both
small and large goals. Some might find it overwhelming, but with good external
tools and practiced workflows, my brain never becomes overwhelmed and I can jump
between different scopes easily. A great notion from the book [Pragmatic
Programmer][1], introduces the idea of programming as a craft and a tool: there
is a time to use your tools and a time to polish your tools. It's good to know
when to get shit done, but additionally when it's time to reflect and see where
you can improve.

###Mixing Skills

A good mix of skills is always useful. I hate hats, as well as the phrase "being
able to wear multiple hats," but the idea fits. If the website is down or dishes
need washing or the iPhone app is crashing, and you can help, go for it.
Penelope Trunk [argues for specializing][2] and while I agree on career focus,
when you are in a small company with a diverse group of people, learn as much as
you can from them.  I think the [Robustness Principle][3] from TCP is a good
analog: own your job and field, but be open to help or ideas from others because
you never know everything.

###Controlled Chaos

Trade offs are always being made at a startup. Speed to market versus amount of
features. Performant now but not for six months from now. The simplest thing is
always the best when starting out, but know what corners you are cutting. Again,
being able to plan for now and for version five, and knowing how to get there is
infinitely valuable. Sometimes everything seems like chaos but being able to
estimate how changes will ripple and planning ahead is great.

On the other hand, having that doing that kind of planning and knowledge leaves
you a great deal of freedom. Look at multiple solutions and figure out what is
best. As a programmer, you control what gets built. If there is new technology
that you want to try and you think it can fit, give it a try. It's been repeated
many times but always be ready to throw out the first version. Build a simple
version, test something new and cool; keep using it or dump it and rebuild it in
a better way the second time.

###Startups Are Hard Work

You will work harder than you expect. Sometimes you will stay up late on
a technical solution that doesn't pan out. Sometimes the business will shift and
you will need to rebuild and update many things. Again, trade offs need to be
made in a small, fast moving startup and sometimes there are technical
consequences. Test hard, keep your product stable, and focus on making progress,
but know when to relax. It depends from person to person how they operate and
what they need to recover, but figure out what that is make sure you do enough
of it to not burn out.

Lastly, don't forget to enjoy the ride. Things will be good, bad, and everywhere
in between. Watching a company grow is fun for me. It's an evolution, an
orchestra, a journey, and for the years you will spend alongside a handful of
people, you should hopefully enjoy it.  I am!

title: Wordcamp Wrapup
---

It was a great day Saturday at Wordcamp, meeting so many interesting people,
fostering some new ideas, and learn quite a lot. I've used wordpress now as my
default blogging software for a few years, but I've never had the opportunity to
get in touch with the community first hand, to see whose really behind the
software. As my first Wordcamp, I had high expectations, and I wasn't let down!

### Early Morning

I showed up to the Mission Bay Center around 9am and was pretty amazed, it was
my first time over by SOMA. Lots of apartment buildings and construction going
on, that area is going to be amazingly once it's all completed. I checked in and
found out that talks had already started! The breakfast food was delicious, with
bagels, fruit, and Peet's coffee. There were 2 conference rooms, upstairs and
downstairs, which were the User Track and Developer Track respectively. After
looking at the entire schedule, I settled on most of the developer talks. The
majority of the talks were only 20-30 minutes long, which was a bit
disappointing. Not enough time to dig into anything really. My highlight of the
morning talks was on LOLCats from Ben Huh. Ben gave a very straightforward talk
about the viral nature of LOLCats and presented things in a serious matter,
which I was surprised about considering the nature of his content. I also
enjoyed the talk on Microformats from Tantek Celik. Microformats have caught my
interest since Kevin Marks demoed them at Google IO, I hope they continue to
gain interest, I think they have a lot of potential.

### Lunch and Afternoon

Buffet style BBQ with macaroni and chicken, vegetarians be damned! Long lines at
first, but they subsided quickly. Another meal done well. I headed into more
talks and was quite happy to hear Nginx mentioned by Chris Lea. Nginx is
a Russian developed webserver that is substantially faster than Apache or
Lighttpd, but due to be Russian, it's always been hard as hell to find docs for
it in English. From what I heard, the situation has improved now, so maybe it's
time to switch back to Nginx now! jQuery was demoed, the Wordpress APIs were
shown, and BuddyPress, a Facebook-like version of Wordpress was shown, to be
public by end of the year.

I found there was a very distinct difference between users and developers,
I could tell which side people were on immediately. Users just created content
and have no clue about anything else. I applaud them for pushing forward and
having a passion, someone needs to poke the developers to be productive. One of
the other interesting aspects with the crowd was the rampant use of flickr and
twitter. Everyone in the room was twittering nonstop. I would post a picture to
flickr, mention it on twitter, and watch it appear on 8 laptop screens
instantly. It was a unique social experience.

One other cool thing were several tattoo of wordpress that were lying around.
They asked us to apply them and mentioned prizes. I added the tattoo to my foot
and then ended up winning a WP Moleskin notepad! Very cool contest and
prize.

### Evening

Things died down by 6pm, but not before a performance by the SEO Rapper aka
Chuck Lewis and it was awesome. I wandered around for a bit and then wound up
early at the after-party at Pete's Tavern with some other folks from the day. We
chatted about the iphone, blogging, and tech stuff in general until 9pm when the
open bar hit! After that, bourbon warmed my belly and I mingled for the rest of
night.

It was a well run event with plenty of volunteers and good food always within
reach. Good talks and good company all around. Matt Mullenweg was the informal
moderator of the entire event and was always hanging around the edges of the
room. From here, I will try to get more involved in the wordpress community and
contribute to wordpress development. Hopefully, I can attend again next year!

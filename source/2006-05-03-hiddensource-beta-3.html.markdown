title: "Hidden:Source Beta 3"

So for those in the know, [Hidden:Source][1] came out with Beta 3 of their Half
Life 2 mod. It is an excellent and very much improved version, which I can't
stop playing. My server has been updated with it and it's running 24/7, as the
name suggests. I've been having issues with Mani Mod and server crashing, but
that seems to be all due to Mani Mod. The server code is alot more stable, which
I love.

If you haven't check out this mod, do so. I could best relate it to the movie
Predator, but more awesome. A team of marines goes to capture an escaped
invisible mutant, who turns the tables and tries to kill them. Very fun gameplay
and mechanics, the thrill that you get playing as the hidden is like nothing
else I have experienced before. Try this mod out!

I've thrown up a new mod called 7th Serpent on the server [here][1]. It is an
excellent total conversion for Max Payne 2, that has been a few years in the
making, just recently announced. Check it out, leave a comment on how you like
it. The website is at [www.7thserpent.com][2].

Also, Congrats to aavenr for his work on the mod, I heard he just recently got
a job offer at DICE!

title: Book Reviews - The Tipping Point And Made To Stick
---


Two for one special today. My reading backlog of late has been oriented on some
well known books covering ideas; how they spread, how they are shared, and how
you can get your ideas to stay in someone's head. I am always interested in
improving how I can communicate with world around me and these books offer some
great viewpoints on that subject.

[The Tipping Point][2]<br>
Malcolm Gladwell<br>
ISBN: 0316346624

### What’s The Point?

The tag line "how little things can make a big difference" covers the point
well. This book covers how small things grow to become huge things; when an
small idea tips and becomes a popular huge idea. This is accomplished via
different types of people that communicate the idea: connectors, mavens, and
salesmen, each with different abilities to connect. Once an idea is shared, how
well it can stick with people is important: Sesame Street and Blues Clues are
both TV shows that did a groundbreaking job at figuring out how to keep kids
stuck watching them. Finally, the context of an idea, knowing when to apply
different tactics, figuring out what is working to make an idea tip, is
important.

### How Was It?

A quick read covering a few pivotal ideas. It is well laid out and easy to
follow. Plenty of usable case studies and hard facts.

### Who Should Read It?

Anyone looking to better understand how ideas work and trying to manipulate how
ideas their ideas are shared.

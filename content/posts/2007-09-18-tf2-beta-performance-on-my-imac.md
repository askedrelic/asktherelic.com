---

Surprise, I'm playing games instead of doing homework.

Well, most of my homework is done and I can put off sleep, so oh well. My main
normal PC died randomly yesterday, so I installed Bootcamp and Windows (ugh) and
got the [Team Fortress 2][1] beta installed tonight.

At default settings, it suggested 1680×1050 and high character detail, low
textures, high shadows, and not much else. It ran about 20-30FPS in a single
player game. I dropped it to like 1280×768 and changed it to high character
detail, medium textures, no color correction or bloom/motion blur, and low
shadows, which put me at around 40-60FPS and having lots of fun.

FYI, I have the 20" Intel Core 2 Duo 2ghz iMac with 2GB of RAM.

As an addendum to [Shared Hosting Sucks][1], I'd like to share what my research
found and where my new future host will be:

[Slicehost.com][2] is a small hosting company located in St. Louis that fits my
needs perfectly. $20 a month gets you 256mb ram, 10gb storage, and 100gb
bandwidth! Once you pay, you have a choice of several different Linux
distributions, of which I chose Debian. It builds the image for you and then
within 15 minutes you have a fully functioning server with an IP address and
full root access. They have an extremely slick Rails management backend
featuring all the important stats about your server, an AJAX command prompt tied
to the hardware, rebooting and shutdown buttons, and a great wiki/tutorial
section to get you started on securing your server. it's all very clean and
exactly what I need.

One of the other awesome thing is the option to rebuild or switch your distro,
not that you would probably use this frequently. Say you get tied of Debian and
want to install Ubunto. 2 clicks and it will delete your current image and
install Ubunto. So simple!

This really is a great solution for a good price. I can't to switch, once my
current shared hosting contract runs out.

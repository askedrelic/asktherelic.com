One of the interesting things I've noticed thanks to having a Blackberry now is
how OCD I've become, checking the device constantly. I have it set to gently
blink whenever new email comes in and only vibrate for an incoming phone call,
but sometimes I find myself looking over to the device almost every 10 minutes,
just expecting something to happen. It's a bad habit to get into, getting
dependent on this device.

I originally got the blackberry for work email and after realizing how useful it
was, added my personal email to the device. It's great being able to have one
mobile source for juggling everything, but it does need a lot of attention at
times. I expect things to happen, I expect a certain amount of email to arrive
every day or hour. It's a good thing for the most part, but sometimes I just
stare the blackberry and shout at it to do something. Entertain me! Why won't
you entertain me? The most annoying element is the "phantom vibrate," when swear
you hear or feel the device vibrating. It could be the bass from the music
vibrating something or a car driving by, but you swear your phone was going off,
and then it wasn't. It's very disconcerting and messes with your mind. Overall
though, mindfuck is definitely worth it for the abilities the Blackberry brings!

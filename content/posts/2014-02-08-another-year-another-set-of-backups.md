title: Another Year, Another Set Of Backups
---


You might not be able to call it a New Years Resolution anyone, but it's not too
late to backup everything you did online last year. I usually get around [to
doing this in December/January][1] over Christmas holiday, but this year I have
been slacking. Maybe you have too. It's not too late, make a backup!

## Files

I have a couple services that I use for my documents, my writing, my photos, and
everything else that is a file. Files are easiest to deal with, as long you have
them organized easily. You always want your files in two places (your current
computer and online), since you will drop your laptop and your current HDD will
fail randomly. You want your files in a simple file format that doesn't depend
on a specific application: usually text, lossless image (PNG), or PDF. PDF might
be a terrible format for technical reasons, but it's a great way to preserve
websites or Word documents exactly how they currently are. Every application has
"Print as PDF".

[Dropbox][2] is the natural choice for most temporary files. You can get 2GB to 5GB
free starting out, it is constantly backed up when you are connected to the
internet, and instantly available across all your devices. I keep most temporary
files in my Dropbox folder, until I can organize them by date and archive them
in a more permanent way.

A more permanent home solution for large file backup is an external HDD or NAS.
I finally invested in a consumer NAS last year, the [Synology Diskstation
DS213][3] for about $200. Drobo is a another well known consumer NAS, but way
too expensive in my opinion, especially considering how cheap hardware has
become. The Synology has really impressed me in ease of use, software quality,
and overall value. Dual disk RAID support, gigabit ethernet, and "app" support
with automatic AWS Glacier backup are some of the more technical features that
really make it impressive. [Here is another good review][4], from the
Wirecutter.

To balance everything out, you want permanent offsite backups: [Backblaze][5] or
[Crashplan][6] are both good. I've used Backblaze for years at work, but am
considering Crashplan personally, since [Backblaze does not support backing up
NAS][7]. These programs are similar to Dropbox, but offer a longterm backup for
around $50/year, which is a great price for safety and value of an offsite
backup.

## Important Online Services

Now that you have someplace to backup files, backup every important online
service you used last year into a simple file format.

* **Email**: most online email providers are now offering simple backup
  solutions, [even Gmail][8].
* **Passwords**: I also switched this year to religiously using [1Password][9],
  an application that stores all of your passwords and automatically fills them
  in, like when you need to access your bank account website. This has not only
  made my life easier, but improved the overall security of my passwords, since
  1Password can generate a unique password for each website you use. I can write
  volumes about this topic, but for now, get some application that stores your
  passwords for you.
* **Bank account and credit card statements**: all my banking is done online
  with e-paper statements. It saves time and paper. At the end of the year, most
  banks offer a Year End Summary, which you should download and store as a PDF.
  Most banks store these statements for up to seven years, but why not keep the
  copy locally? It makes keeping financial records much easier.
* **Bookmarks**: Pinboard is an online bookmark service I use, which [offers an
  export here][10]. If you just use Firefox or Chrome bookmarks and have
  hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, back them up!
* **Social media services**: I used to find value in Twitter, Facebook,
  LinkedIn, but lately, I don't think the value is worth longterm backing up.
  JWZ argues for backing these services up and [offers some helpful
  exporters][11]. Facebook offers an [export under Settings][12] and [Twitter
  does also][13].

## Physical Things

Another project I started last year was backing up my childhood photo albums and
VHS tapes! Well, I called my mom and asked her to mail them to me, but it's
a first step. How many boxes of tapes or old photographs do you have at your
parent's house? Convert them to a digital format today, before they fall apart.

![Legoland 1994][15]

I've looked at local video conversion places and have been quoted $25/tape for
VHS to digital conversions, which seems pricey. I think I will wait to find
a VCR and manually convert the videos myself with an [Elgato USB recorder][14],
which seems to offer a good value/quality trade off.

That's my recommendation for the year. Everything that is physical fades
eventually and everything that is digital can instantly disappear if you aren't
careful. Understand the digital world and do what is necessary to preserve your
important memories and documents!

Checking in from [Wordcamp 2008][1] right now! Here for the day, hoping to learn
and meet some people that I only know through blogs! There's a nice mix of user
and developer oriented talks, along with some delicious food so far. The Mission
Bay Center is a very new and grand center, it's a great place to host this
event. I will check in later with some more reviews and info hopefully.

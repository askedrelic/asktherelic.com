I guess it's a big deal to me when I legally purchase software, because I just
don't do it very often. Piracy and other methods aside, most applications I use
are actually open source or free. Free software is nearly as good or better than
other software out there, for what I need generally. [Coda][1] though is a
professional web designer solution that is totally worth paying for.

Coda basically gives you one simple interface for everything you would need as a
web designer. Check their site, it has a nice design worth checking out purely
for the visual effects, but it also explains its abilities better than I can. I
basically love the ability to create a profile for a project/site, storing FTP
and SSH passwords for easy access, then just focusing on the project, keeping
everything combined and balanced in one window. You can have the remote server
on side, ready to FTP files using the powerful [Transmit engine][2] and files
ready to edit on the side side, using the likewise powerful [SubethaEdit][3]
engine. You can visually edit CSS files and using Regex search for functions. If
you want to really change things, you pop open an SSH window without having to
login and you can just work.

Overall, I find it has a great interface thanks to Apple's beautiful design and
it enables you to work very quickly. Worth the money!!

Still trying to get my trip in China written up, but a busy school schedule and
great snowboarding this winter has taken precedence over the writting! To top
that off, I'm 5 minutes from leaving for <a title="http://www.shmoocon.org/"
href="http://www.shmoocon.org/">Shmoocon</a>, a hacking and security conference
in Washington, DC! If anyone who reads this is going, send me and email! I plan
on taking pictures and providing a summary of the event when I get back, so have
fun this weekend!

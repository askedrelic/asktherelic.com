Over the weekend,
<a title="http://www.barcamproc.org/" href="http://www.barcamproc.org/">Barcamp
Rochester</a> 4 took place here on campus at RIT. I have been helping to plan
this event over the last few months and was pleased that it went off with any
major problems! Around 60-80 people showed up of the course of an entire
Saturday and there was a lock picking village that was open most of the day. I
arranged most of the food and it seemed like my estimates were in order, I don't
think anyone left hungry!

To explain a bit further,
<a title="http://www.barcamp.org/" href="http://www.barcamp.org/">Barcamp</a> is
a kind of informal conference, where everyone who comes, presents about a topic
of their interest. Anything goes and most of the presentations are pretty
informal, leading to open discussions about some topic occasionally. I enjoy the
format overall, it's flexible and focuses on sharing information in the simplest
way possible.

My presentation was on
<a title="http://www.openlaszlo.org/" href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/">OpenLaszlo</a>
and Flex, two technologies for creating rich internet applications. I had
interned at Laszlo, the company that makes OpenLaszlo, over this previous summer
and got them to send me out a box of t-shirts and swag to give away also. I felt
it went off pretty well and I had a handful of people who came and listened.
Several other of my friends gave talks on RF signals, Python, open government,
Dwarf Fortress, and a whole host of topics. Overall, it was a good event!

title: Blackberry Sync under OSX

The state of affairs in OSX with Blackberries is pretty sad. RIM offers a free
program called [PocketMac][1], which amazingly works, but sucks very badly. It
hasn't been updated in a long time and is not a Universal binary.

As part of my organizational work, I'm getting my contacts all in sync with
Address Book in OSX, then dumping them to Gmail and my Blackberry. I have a PC
with the RIM syncing software, which works fine and is a well developed piece of
software, but i don't want to add an extra middle man to my syncing. Overall,
the software has a shitty installer, terrible Mac interface, slow performance,
and lack of options and documentation. However, it does seem to work. I tried
just doing a 1-way with my contacts, dumping them on the Blackberry, and syncing
my Notes on the Blackberry to Stickies on OSX.

- Contacts sync 1-way fine, but it is a complete 1-way sync. It deletes all
  contacts on the Blackberry first, then overwrites your contacts. I have to try
  a 2-way sync, but I'm cautious because I don't want the Blackberry deleting
  info on the Address Book.
- Notes lose their title, but they transfer fine to Stickies. 2-way sync works
  fine.

I'm keeping it simple and not gonna try Calendar sync or anything. Overall, this
is a very negative review, but I can't complain too much because it _does_ work.
Oh well.

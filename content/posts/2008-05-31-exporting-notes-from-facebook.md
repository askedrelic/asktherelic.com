title: Exporting Notes From Facebook
---

I'm importing some lost data tonight thanks to Facebook Notes. My FB Notes are
subscribed to this blog's RSS feed, it pulls down all my posts and re-posts
them. It's kinda of a waste to duplicate data, however, my friends are on FB and
I get some hits from that. It has also saved my ass when my host crashes and
loses all my posts! My posts exists on FB, however, due to the closed wall
environment that FB has, you have to work hard to pull it out.

The trick is that FB has an RSS feed of your last 10 Notes, whether you wrote
them on FB or imported them from elsewhere. WordPress allows you to import RSS
feeds. Find the RSS feed on FB that your 10 last Notes and save it locally to
your computer, then import it into WP! To access your FB Notes past the first
10, delete the Notes you just imported off FB and your RSS feed will update to
10 new notes. Repeat until all your data is off FB and onto WP!

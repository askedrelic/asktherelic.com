I've been writing on this site for a couple years now, slowing figuring out how
to organize things and finding out what I like to write about. I've finally come
the conclusion that it's time to split into two sites, [asktherelic.com][1] and
[thebehrensventure.com][2].

Ask the Relic (this blog) will focus on programming, sys admin, web dev, and
other tech things I'm trying to make a career out of, while TheBehrensVenture
will focus on my random travels, stories, and adventures. Two very different
themes, deserving of different methods of display. The Behrens Venture had
running on Wordpress and will continue to do so. I love WP's simple plugins and
content management capabilities. It's damn simple to upload a picture and write
something up. However, when posting longer how-tos or source code, WP wasn't
cutting it. This blog, AskTheRelic will now be run off [Blogofile][3], a Python
static file compiler. It's Python, which I love using, and is super easy to
tinker with. I can also now keep this entire site under source control, git
specifically, which is awesome.

I've split up most of my travel/tech posts and moved them to their respective
sites. I'm still cleaning up AskTheRelic, but I hope to keep moving things
forward slowly. This is all work in progress, bear with me!
